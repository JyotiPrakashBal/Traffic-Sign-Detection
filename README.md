# Traffic-Sign-Detection
In this project, we use convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. </br>

After the model is trained, we will then test model program on new images of traffic signs we find on the web.
